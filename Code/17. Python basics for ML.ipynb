    "            Multiset: A multiset (or bag, or mset) is a modification of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows for multiple instances for each of its elements. The number of instances given for each element is called the multiplicity of that element in the multiset. Multisets are containers that store elements following a specific order, and where multiple elements can have equivalent values i.e same element can appear multiple times unlike set. \n",
    "            In a multiset, the value of an element also identifies it (the value is itself the key). The value of the elements in a multiset cannot be modified once in the container (the elements are always const), but they can be inserted or removed from the container. Internally, the elements in a multiset are always sorted following a specific strict weak ordering criterion indicated by its internal comparison object (of type Compare). multiset containers are generally slower than unordered_multiset containers to access individual elements by their key, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on their order. Multisets are typically implemented as binary search trees.\n",

But append() only appends one single element at a time or multiple elements as a list  where as \"+\" operator can append more than element that is given as list or tuple.

    "    Tuple is just like a list that behaves like an array of mixed data(heterogenous) but it cannot be modified after it is created. It is immutable. Creating a tuple is just like creating a list, except using parentheses, (): We can access tuple elements using indexing. But you cannot assign/modify a new value to a tuple because a tuple is immutable. If you try to do it, Python will throw a TypeError with the reason that the tuple does not support the item assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: In Python, creating a tuple with one element is a bit tricky. Having one element within parentheses is not enough. We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is a tuple. We can also create tuple without braces\n",
    "                var1 = (\"Hello\") # string\n",
    "                var2 = (\"Hello\",) # tuple\n",

    "                \n",
    "     Advantages:\n",
    "     -----------\n",
    "     We generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types. But lists can also have heterogeneous data.\n",
    "    Since tuples are immutable, iterating through a tuple is faster than with a list. So there is a slight performance boost.\n",
    "    Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary. With lists, this is not possible.\n",
    "    If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected."

For efficient storage of these strings, the sequence of code points is converted into a set of bytes. The process is known as encoding. There are various encodings present which treat a string differently. The popular encodings being utf-8, ascii, etc. \n",

    "    -------------------------------------- \n",
    "        Iterators allow you to make an iterable that computes its items as it goes. Which means that you can make iterables that are \"lazy\", in that \"they don’t determine what their next item is until you ask them for it.\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Using an iterator instead of a list, set, or another iterable data structure can sometimes allow us to save memory.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        For example, we can use itertools.repeat to create an iterable that provides 100 million 4’s to us. This iterator takes up 48 bytes of memory. An equivalent list of 100 million 4’s takes up many megabytes of memory.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       While iterators can save memory, they can also save time. For example if you wanted to print out just the first line of a 10 gigabyte log file, you could do this:\n",
    "                    -- print(next(open('giant_log_file.txt')))\n",
    "       This gives the first line in a giant file.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Note: File objects in Python are implemented as iterators. As you loop over a file, data is read into memory one line at a time. If we instead used the readlines method to store all lines in memory, we might run out of system memory."

    "    The function above is to pick a random row of a pandas dataframe as a starting point and clip the next several rows as a one-time interval sample. This process is repeated several times to collect many time intervals into one batch. When we collect enough interval samples, at the second to the last line in the above function, the batch is dispatched using the yield command. You may have already noticed that generator functions do not have a return statement. In this example, the function will run forever. This is useful and necessary because it allows our Keras training process to run as many epochs as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we do not use a generator, we will need to convert the dataframe into all possible time intervals and keep them in memory for the training loop. This will be a lot of repeating data (because the time intervals are overlapping) and take up a lot of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Because it is useful, Keras has some generator function predefined in the library. Below is an example of the \"ImageDataGenerator()\". We have loaded the cifar10 dataset of 32×32 images in x_train. The data is connected to the generator via the flow() method. The next() function returns the next batch of data. In the example below, there are 4 calls to next(). In each case, 8 images are returned as the batch size is 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Below is the entire code that also displays all images after every call to next()."

    "#### ------------------------------ Decorating classes ------------------------------\n",
    "    There are two different ways you can use decorators on classes.\n",
    "    The first way is very close to what you have already done with functions: you can decorate the methods of a class.\n",
    "    Some commonly used decorators that are even built-ins in Python are @classmethod, @staticmethod, and @property.\n",
    "    The @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators are used to define methods inside a class namespace that are not connected to a particular instance of that class.\n",
    "    The @property decorator is used to customize getters and setters for class attributes.\n",
    "    The second way to use decorators on classes is to decorate the whole class.\n",
    "    Writing a class decorator is very similar to writing a function decorator.\n",
    "    The only difference is that the decorator will receive a class and not a function as an argument.\n",
    "    In fact, all the decorators you saw above will work as class decorators. \n",
    "    When you are using them on a class instead of a function, their effect might not be what you want\n",
    "    The meaning of the syntax is similar to the function decorators.\n",
    "    A common use of class decorators is to be a simpler alternative to some use-cases of metaclasses.\n",
    "    In both cases, you are changing the definition of a class dynamically."

    "          \"File descriptors\" are identifiers that represents the open files in the os kernel and are kept in a table of files. Typically, they have non-negative values(numbers). Negative results denote an error or a \"no value\" condition. In other words, a file descriptor is an unsigned integer used by a process to identify an open file.\n",

    "          write() sends the data from your program into the IO subsystem where it may be buffered. flush() tells the IO subsystem that you would like to commit(write the data to file) any data that has been buffered. Note, if you've not previously called write, flush will do nothing. The flush() method in Python file handling clears the internal buffer of the file.\n",

    "          Think about it in the context of a pipe stream that is connected to something that is reading from that stream at the other end. write(b) contributes b to that stream's buffer on your end. It may or may not actually put all those bytes into the stream buffer for it to 'sent' down the stream to the reader at the other end. flush() on the other hand takes everything that is in the stream's buffer, and 'sends' it to the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Basically, you use write(b) to load your data onto the stream, and then you all flush() at the end to make sure that everything has actually gone into the underlying stream and 'been sent', rather than sitting in the stream's buffer. So, for example, if I connect my computer to another device using the PySerial package (which creates a serial connection that effectively works as a stream), then to put some data into that stream, I will use write(b). To make certain that all that data has gone through the serial connection and through to the other device however, I will call flush(). This is because write(b) doesn't guarantee that all (or any in fact) of that data will actually be sent to the other device immediately. \n",

For instance, instead of joining two paths with + like regular strings, you should use os.path.join(), which joins paths using the correct path separator on the operating system. Recall that Windows uses \\ while Mac and Linux use / as a separator. This difference can lead to hard-to-spot errors, such as our example above working for only Windows paths.\n",

    "     The pathlib module was introduced in Python 3.4 to deal with these challenges. It gathers the necessary functionality in one place and makes it available through methods and properties on an easy-to-use Path object. The Python pathlib module provides an easier method to interact with the filesystem no matter what the operating system is. It allows a more intuitive, more pythonic way to interface with file paths (the name of a file including any of its directories and subdirectories). In the os module, paths are regular strings.\n",
    "     Early on, other packages still used strings for file paths, but as of Python 3.6, the pathlib module is supported throughout the standard library, partly due to the addition of a file system path protocol.\n",
    "     \n",
    "#### Creating Paths:\n",
    "         All we really need to know about is the \"pathlib.Path class\". There are a few different ways of creating a path. \n",
    "         \n",
    "         First of all, there are classmethods like .cwd() (Current Working Directory) and .home() (your user’s home directory) to create a path\n"

However, in many contexts, backslash is also used as an escape character in order to represent non-printable characters. To avoid problems, use raw string literals to represent Windows paths. These are string literals that have an r prepended to them. In raw string literals, the \\ represents a literal backslash: r'C:\\Users' i.e it is treated as backslash string literally rather than an escape character."

For instance, in Python 3.5, the configparser standard library can only use string paths to read files. The way to handle such cases is to do the conversion to a string explicitly\n",

    "\n",
    "    Possibly the most unusual part of the pathlib library is the use of the / operator. For a little peek under the hood, let us see how that is implemented. This is an example of operator overloading: the behavior of an operator is changed depending on the context. You have seen this before. Think about how + means different things for strings and numbers. Python implements operator overloading through the use of double underscore methods (a.k.a. dunder methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The / operator is defined by the .__truediv__() method. In fact, if you take a look at the source code of pathlib, you’ll see something like:\n",

    "    Conclusion:\n",
    "    -----------\n",
    "    Since Python 3.4, pathlib has been available in the standard library. With pathlib, file paths can be represented by proper Path objects instead of plain strings as before. These objects make code dealing with file paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Easier to read, especially because / is used to join paths together\n",
    "        - More powerful, with most necessary methods and properties available directly on the object\n",
    "        - More consistent across operating systems, as peculiarities of the different systems are hidden by the Path object"

    "#### Deque: Building Efficient Queues and Stacks\n",
    "    Initially, collections only included one data structure, deque, which was specially designed as a \"double-ended queue\" that \"supports efficient append and pop operations on either end of the sequence\". From this point on, several modules in the standard library took advantage of deque to improve the performance of their classes and structures. Some outstanding examples are queue and threading.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This sequence-like data type is a generalization of stacks and queues designed to support memory-efficient and fast append and pop operations on both ends of the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: The word deque is pronounced \"deck\" and stands for double-ended queue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Python, append and pop operations on the beginning or left side of list objects are inefficient, with O(n) time complexity. These operations are especially expensive if you’re working with large lists because Python has to move all the items to the right to insert new items at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On the other hand, append and pop operations on the right side of a list are normally efficient (O(1)) except for those cases in which Python needs to reallocate memory to grow the underlying list for accepting new items.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python’s deque was created to overcome this problem. Append and pop operations on both sides of a deque object are stable and equally efficient because deques are implemented as a doubly linked list. That’s why deques are particularly useful for creating stacks and queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Take a queue as an example. It manages items in a First-In/First-Out (FIFO) fashion. It works as a pipe, where you push in new items at one end of the pipe and pop old items out from the other end. Adding an item to the end of a queue is known as an enqueue operation. Removing an item from the front or beginning of a queue is called dequeue.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Now say you’re modeling a queue of people waiting to buy tickets to a movie. You can do that with a deque. Every time a new person arrives, you enqueue them. When the person at the front of the queue gets their tickets, you dequeue them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here’s how we can emulate the process using a deque object. We first create an empty deque object to represent the queue of people. To enqueue a person, you can use .append(), which adds items to the right end of a deque. To dequeue a person, you use .popleft(), which removes and returns items on the left end of a deque"

    "#### OrderedDict: Keeping Your Dictionaries Ordered\n",
    "    Sometimes you need your dictionaries to remember the order in which key-value pairs are inserted. Python’s regular dictionaries were unordered data structures for years. So, back in 2008, PEP 372 introduced the idea of adding a new dictionary class to collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The new class would remember the order of items based on the moment in which keys were inserted. That was the origin of OrderedDict.\n",
    "\n",
    "    OrderedDict was introduced in Python 3.1. Its application programming interface (API) is substantially the same as dict. However, OrderedDict iterates over keys and values in the same order keys were first inserted into the dictionary. If you assign a new value to an existing key, then the order of the key-value pair remains unchanged. If an entry is deleted and reinserted, then it’ll be moved to the end of the dictionary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    There are several ways to create OrderedDict objects. Most of them are identical to how you create a regular dictionary. For example, you can create an empty ordered dictionary by instantiating the class without arguments and then insert key-value pairs as needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Python 3.6 introduced a new implementation of standard dict. This implementation provides an unexpected new feature: now regular dictionaries keep their items in the same order they’re first inserted. Initially, the feature was considered an implementation detail, and the documentation advised not to rely on it. However, since Python 3.7, the feature is officially part of the language specification. So, what’s the point of using OrderedDict?\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are some features of OrderedDict that still make it valuable:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Intent communication: With OrderedDict, your code will make it clear that the order of items in the dictionary is important. You’re clearly communicating that your code needs or relies on the order of items in the underlying dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Control over the order of items: With OrderedDict, you have access to .move_to_end(), which is a method that allows you to manipulate the order of items in your dictionary. You’ll also have an enhanced variation of .popitem() that allows removing items from either end of the underlying dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Equality test behavior: With OrderedDict, equality tests between dictionaries take the order of items into account. So, if you have two ordered dictionaries with the same group of items but in a different order, then your dictionaries will be considered non-equal.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - There is at least one more reason for using OrderedDict: backward compatibility. Relying on regular dict objects to preserve the order of items will break your code in environments that run versions of Python older than 3.6."

If your list is short, then counting its items can be straightforward and quick. If you have a long list, then counting the items will be more challenging.\n",

    "#### ChainMap: Chaining Dictionaries Together\n",
    "    Python’s ChainMap groups multiple dictionaries and other mappings together to create a single object that works pretty much like a regular dictionary. In other words, it takes several mappings and makes them logically appear as one.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ChainMap objects are updateable views, which means that changes in any of the chained mappings affect the ChainMap object as a whole. This is because ChainMap doesn’t merge the input mappings together. It keeps a list of mappings and reimplements common dictionary operations on top of that list. For example, a key lookup searches the list of mappings successively until it finds the key.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When you’re working with ChainMap objects, you can have several dictionaries with either unique or repeated keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In either case, ChainMap allows you to treat all your dictionaries as one. If you have unique keys across your dictionaries, you can access and update the keys as if you were working with a single dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you have repeated keys across your dictionaries, besides managing your dictionaries as one, you can also take advantage of the internal list of mappings to define some sort of access priority. Because of this feature, ChainMap objects are great for handling multiple contexts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For eg, say you’re working on a command-line interface (CLI) application. The application allows the user to use a proxy service for connecting to the Internet. The settings priorities are:\n",
    "\n",
    "                   1. Command-line options (--proxy, -p)\n",
    "                   2. Local configuration files in the user’s home directory\n",
    "                   3. Global proxy configuration\n",
    "                   \n",
    "    If the user supplies a proxy at the command line using --proxy or -p, then the application must use that proxy. Otherwise, the application should use the proxy provided in the next local configuration object, and so on. This is one of the most common use cases of ChainMap. In this situation, you can do as in the following example.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If you observe below, ChainMap allows you to define the appropriate priority for the application’s proxy configuration. A key lookup searches cmd_proxy, then local_proxy, and finally global_proxy, returning the first instance of the key at hand. In this example, the user doesn’t provide a proxy at the command line, so your application uses the proxy in local_proxy."

However, the internal implementation of built-in types makes it hard to safely inherit from them without rewriting a significant amount of code.

    "### CSV module\n",
    "    you need to get information into and out of your programs through more than just the keyboard and console. Exchanging information through text files is a common way to share info between programs. One of the most popular formats for exchanging data is the CSV format. But how do we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let’s get one thing clear: we don’t have to (and we won’t) build our own CSV parser from scratch. There are several perfectly acceptable libraries we can use. The Python csv library will work for most cases. If our work requires lots of data or numerical analysis, the pandas library has CSV parsing capabilities as well, which should handle the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Lets see how to read, process, and parse CSV from text files using Python csv module and pandas module.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     What Is a CSV File?\n",
    "     -------------------\n",
    "        A CSV file (Comma Separated Values file) is a type of plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data. Because it’s a plain text file, it can contain only actual text data—in other words, printable ASCII or Unicode characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The structure of a CSV file is given away by its name. Normally, CSV files use a comma to separate each specific data value. Here’s what that structure looks like:\n",
    "        \n",
    "                            column 1 name,column 2 name, column 3 name\n",
    "                            first row data 1,first row data 2,first row data 3\n",
    "                            second row data 1,second row data 2,second row data 3\n",
    "                            ...\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Notice how each piece of data is separated by a comma. Normally, the first line identifies each piece of data—in other words, the name of a data column. Every subsequent line after that is actual data and is limited only by file size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In general, the separator character is called a delimiter, and the comma is not the only one used. Other popular delimiters include the tab (\\t), colon (:) and semi-colon (;) characters. Properly parsing a CSV file requires us to know which delimiter is being used.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Where Do CSV Files Come From?\n",
    "    -------------------------------\n",
    "    CSV files are normally created by programs that handle large amounts of data. They are a convenient way to export data from spreadsheets and databases as well as import or use it in other programs. For example, you might export the results of a data mining program to a CSV file and then import that into a spreadsheet to analyze the data, generate graphs for a presentation, or prepare a report for publication.\n",
    "\n",
    "    CSV files are very easy to work with programmatically. Any language that supports text file input and string manipulation (like Python) can work with CSV files directly.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parsing CSV Files With Python’s Built-in CSV Library:\n",
    "    ------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "    The csv library provides functionality to both read from and write to CSV files. Designed to work out of the box with Excel-generated CSV files, it is easily adapted to work with a variety of CSV formats. The csv library contains objects and other code to read, write, and process data from and to CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reading CSV Files With csv:\n",
    "    ---------------------------\n",
    "    Reading from a CSV file is done using the reader object. The CSV file is opened as a text file with Python’s built-in open() function, which returns a file object. This is then passed to the reader, which does the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here’s the employee_birthday.txt file:\n",
    "            name,department,birthday month\n",
    "            John Smith,Accounting,November\n",
    "            Erica Meyers,IT,March\n",
    "            \n",
    "    In the below program, each row returned by the reader is a list of String elements containing the data found by removing the delimiters. The first row returned contains the column names, which is handled in a special way."
